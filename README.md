# Student Dropout Prediction

Around the world, a lot of pupils leave school each year. This impairs their social and economic development, lowers the nation's literacy rate, and fosters a non-innovative atmosphere. In India, the topic of dropouts is particularly significant and intriguing.

According to a recent poll by the National Statistical Office (NSO), 17.5% of upper elementary pupils and 19.8% of secondary students, 12.6% of kids in India respectively stopped their studies. A dropout, according to the poll, is a person who has "ever enrolled" but has not finished the most recent level of school for which they have registered. They are also not presently enrolled in any educational setting.

Getting to know about the conditions that results in the dropouts of students may result in decrese of droupouts. Our machine learning model runs on various factors that effect a student to drop out of education. The model provides the educators whether the student drops out of education or not. We have used 7 classification algorithms from sklearn to obtain that model that provides better accuracy on the dataset.
