# Student Dropout Prediction

📚🌍 A significant and intriguing issue around the world is the high number of school dropouts among pupils each year. This has adverse effects on their social and economic development, leading to a decline in the nation's literacy rate and hindering innovation. 📉 In India, this issue is particularly noteworthy.

📊 According to a recent poll by the National Statistical Office (NSO) in India, approximately 17.5% of upper elementary pupils and 19.8% of secondary students, along with 12.6% of kids overall, have discontinued their studies. 🚫 A "dropout" in this context refers to a person who was enrolled in education at some point but did not complete the most recent level they were registered for and is currently not attending any educational institution.

🤖 To address this problem, a machine learning model has been developed to identify the factors that contribute to student dropouts. The model utilizes seven classification algorithms from the sklearn library to predict whether a student is likely to drop out of education or not. 🧠 By leveraging these algorithms, educators can intervene early and provide necessary support to at-risk students, potentially reducing dropout rates. 📚✨💻

🎯 The ultimate goal is to increase retention rates and create a more inclusive and innovative educational environment for the students. 📈🌟🎓
